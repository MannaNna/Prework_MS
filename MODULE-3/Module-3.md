In order for me to be successful, I have a plan to handle the challenges ahead.
The plan has already begun, by taking charge of my learning. Before even signing up for the boot camp I already started my learning using the social networking site YouTube by searching for tutorials on web development specifically HTML5 and CSS3. While working on these tutorials  I have realized some really important key things. Time and patience are going to be critical for successful learning web development. I plan to spend most of my free time after work and on weekends studying and practicing web development. Learning to be patient is something I am constantly working on and this will be no different for this boot camp.

 Availability of information is no longer an issue in today's age and is only limited by one’s ability to master the Google-Fu. I will apply this into my plan for success. 

A sharp mind is influenced by the person's physical health. Through diet, exercise, plenty of rest I plan to keep my body in good health like I’ve always done. 

Excitement is causing me to count the remaining days until May 13th when I can finally meet other students with the same desire and to collaborate with them on projects and assignments.
